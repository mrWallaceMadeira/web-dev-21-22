Another tedious task to automate with bash!
Write a bash script to do the following:
    1. Ask the user what they'd like their project to be named
    2. Create a project structure that looks like the following

    PROJECT_NAME
    |
    --index.html
    --styles.css

    The HTML file should be filled with "HTML boilerplate code" & properly linked to CSS
